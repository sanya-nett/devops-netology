# ДЗ 7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ

Вывод команды `terraform workspace list`.
```commandline
ascherba@~/Repositories/devops-netology/terraform(terraform-03)$ terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage

```

Вывод команды `terraform plan` для воркспейса `prod`.
```commandline
ascherba@~/Repositories/devops-netology/terraform(terraform-03)$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
